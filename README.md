# Skynet Chat

This is my first ever web application, it's a simple chat application where the user interacts with the computer, which responds with random responses.

## Features

1) Username: User enters their name when the page opens, which serves as their display name throughout the messaging.

2) Welcome: Skynet responds with a welcome message, using the user's name.

3) Colour bubbles: Like most modern chat applications, messages appear in coloured bubbles, user's colour is blue and the computer's is
   silver.

4) Timestamp: Every message bubble has a small display of the time it was posted in the bottom right corner.

5) Most recent message: Like any chat application, the scrollbar follows the most recent message, as it is posted.

6) Random responses: In our script file have an array of 20 preloaded responses, each time the user sends a message, Skynet responds with 
   one of these messages at random.

7) Time delays: To provide some semblance of real life conversational flow, Skynet doesn't respond immediately, there is a delay which
   ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 seconds. The delay is short enough to provide a nice flow, but not long enough to disengage the user, whom of course
   knows they are not talking to a human.

8) Responsive: Use of CSS Flexbox makes the application responsive in the browser.
